15-Puzzle Breadth-First-Search Instructions

This program was written in Python Version: 3.12.1
The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Version : 1.86.0

When running this program it will just use of the precongfigured puzzles that was already hard coded in. 
If you wish to try a different puzzle configuration please just change the string in main that is used inside of solve()
Make sure that your string is of lenght 16 / that it uses the numbers 0-15. You can put them in any order you would like.
Then just hit the run button on the program if you are using an IDE. In my case VSCode provides with run button on the top right. 

Side Note: Feel free to ignore the commented out piece of code above main (solve 2 and randomPuzzleGen) This was meant to randomly generate puzzles
that the search would have to solve. Unfortunately I haven't managed to get it working so please ignore it for now.  

Notes: I need to make a C++ and Java version of the search algorithm just for fun in the future.
